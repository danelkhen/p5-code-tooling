=head1 NAME

Source::Tooling - Source (Code) Tooling for Perl 5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

WIP, please ignore. Basically this is just to make it easier
for me to share between work and home computer.

=head2 Installation-(ish)

Assuming you have a checkout and are within that
directory you can just do the following:

    perlbrew install perl-5.22.2
    perlbrew use perl-5.22.2
    cpanm --installdeps .

Go get some coffee, this can take a while.
